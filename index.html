	<h2>01012023 POST TITLE</h2>

	<p>
	Post body. Lots of text, idk what it says. Does formatting inside an html paragraph get displayed or do you need to start a whole new paragraph? I don't know, this is a test to find out and to design the rest of the page. Lets put a couple more sentences here so that we get a nice, beefy paragraph. Then we can see what happens when we put in a line break. Ok, this seems like enough words, let's tru a line break.
	There is a question that, when asked,
	Cannot be taken back.
	A gun, once held, that can't be passed
	Or placed back on it's rack

	Until it's shot. Shot by you.
	The question, one of aim:
	Dissolve eternal into blue
	or crystalize in flame.
