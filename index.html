	<p>
	Post body. Lots of text, idk what it says. Does formatting inside an html paragraph get displayed or do you need to start a whole new paragraph? I don't know, this is a test to find out and to design the rest of the page. Lets put a couple more sentences here so that we get a nice, beefy paragraph. Then we can see what happens when we put in a line break. Ok, this seems like enough words, let's tru a line break.

	<p>There is a question that, when asked,</p>
	<p>Cannot be taken back.</p>
	<p>A gun, once held, that can't be passed</p>
	<p>Or placed back on it's rack</p>

	<p>Until it's shot. Shot by you.</p>
	<p>The question, one of aim:</p>
	<p>Dissolve eternal into blue</p>
	<p>or crystalize in flame.</p>
